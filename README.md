Tic Tac toe using vanilla javascript with play with computer option

> I created this code at around 2018, when I was beginner of javascript. It uses very straightforward logic to play with players and it's not completele. Now I am a lot confident on javascript, I have been planning to do this right way by actually using minmax algorithm and proper graphics engine but never got a any free time.
